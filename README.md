# Anyonica
WL package for finding and exploring properties of fusion categories

## Installation 

1. Download the paclet file from the latest release at https://github.com/gert-vercleyen/Anyonica/releases.
2. Locate the file path of the paclet file and evaluate ```PacletInstall["path_of_paclet_file"]``` in Mathematica. If you don't know how to find the path of a file you can also type ```PacletInstall["``` in Mathematica, and it should offer to browse the files on your computer.

## Loading the package
To load the package, evaluate 
```
<<Anyonica`
```
in Mathematica. If this is the first time you load the package, it can take some time. After the first time, however, loading it again should be fast.

## Documentation
There is a notebook Documentation.nb at the top of the code directory, which can also be downloaded from [https://github.com/gert-vercleyen/Anyonica/releases]. This notebook contains typical use cases for many functions. 

I am working on implementing complete documentation in the documentation center, but this takes time.
